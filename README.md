## Goals:

2. All on the stack (no malloc challenge)
3. No buffering (no large arrays with potential empty items)
4. Variables kept to a minimum, use bit setting for booleans), no weird unweildy structures
5. Minimize errors on undefined behavior as much as possible
6. Extra conversion for binary (b and B)
