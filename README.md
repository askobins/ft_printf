# ft\_printf
42 project ft\_printf (2019 version)

## Goals:

1. All bonuses
2. All on the stack (no malloc challenge)
3. No buffering (no large arrays with potential empty items)
4. No structures (variables kept to a minimum, use bit setting for booleans)
5. No crashing. Ever.
6. Extra conversions for convenience?
